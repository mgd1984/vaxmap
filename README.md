# VaxMap - Ontario Vaccine Clinic Map

@VaxHuntersCan and volunteers have put together the VaxFinder API (https://vax-availability-api.azurewebsites.net/swagger) which is an excellent source of vaccine information for Ontario residents.   

This repo contains code to connect to the VaxFinder API and to build an interactive map using R, Leaflet & Shiny. 

Areas for Improvement:
- Make the map more useful by incorporating more VaxFinderAPI endpoints as search parameters 
- Fix anomalies (incorrectly geocoded coordinates, etc.)
